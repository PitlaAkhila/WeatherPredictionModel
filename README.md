# AI-WeatherPredictionModel
#INTRODUCTION:

The science of forecasting the weather is crucial. Accurate forecasting can lessen property damage and save lives. The ability to track the ideal time to plant or assist farmers in protecting their crops makes it essential for agriculture as well.

And in the upcoming years, its importance will only increase. Because of climate change and variability, severe weather events are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity.

Machine Learning Models:

A machine learning model is a representation of an algorithm that searches through vast amounts of data to look for patterns or forecast the future. The mathematical powerhouses of artificial intelligence are machine learning (ML) models, which are fed by data.

For instance, a computer vision ML model may be able to recognize autos and pedestrians in a real-time video. To translate words and sentences, one may use natural language processing.

A.	Logistic regression:
Based on some dependent variables, the machine learning classification process known as logistic regression is used to forecast the likelihood of a given class. In essence, the logistic regression model generates the logistic of the outcome after computing the sum of the input features (in most cases, there is a bias term).

For a binary classification problem, logistic regression's result is always between 0 and 1, which is appropriate. The likelihood that the current sample will be assigned to class=1

How it works:

A statistical method known as logistic regression is used to forecast the likelihood of a binary response based on one or more independent factors. This indicates that logistic regression is used to forecast outcomes with two possible values, such as 0 or 1, pass or fail, yes or no, etc., given a set of parameters.

In the image below, you can find the accuracy and evaluation of the logistic regression model with our dataset.

  Accuracy: 81.69999999999999 %
The root mean square error is :  0.6544867736464346
The R2 Score is :  -0.2247191011235954
The Mean Absolute error is :  0.1834862385321101


B.	Decision Tree:
One of the well-known and effective supervised machine learning methods that may be applied to classification and regression issues is the decision tree. Decision rules that were taken from the training data formed the basis of the model. When solving a regression problem, the model substitutes the value for the class and utilizes the mean squared error as a measure of judgment accuracy.



How it works:
There are three different sorts of nodes in this tree-structured classifier. The root node, which can be further broken into nodes, is the first node that represents the complete sample. Internal nodes stand in for the dataset's attributes and branching for the decision-making processes. The outcome is represented by the leaf node at the end. When trying to solve problems involving decisions, this algorithm is highly helpful.

In the image below, you can find the accuracy and evaluation of the logistic regression model with our dataset. We can observe that this model gives us 100% accuracy.

Accuracy: 100.0 %
The root mean square error is :  0.0
The R2 Score is :  1.0
The Mean Absolute error is :  0.0

C.	Support Vector Classifier:
A supervised machine learning model called a support vector machine (SVM) employs classification techniques to solve two-group classification problems. An SVM model can classify new text after being given sets of labeled training data for each category.

They offer two key advantages over more recent algorithms like neural networks: greater speed and improved performance with fewer samples (in the thousands). As a result, the approach is excellent for text classification issues, where it's typical to only have access to a dataset with a few thousand tags on each sample.

How Does it Work:
SVM categorizes data points even when they are not otherwise linearly separable by mapping the data to a high-dimensional feature space. Once a separator between the categories is identified, the data are converted to enable the hyperplane representation of the separator. The group to which a new record should belong can therefore be predicted using the features of new data.

In the image below, you can find the accuracy and evaluation of the logistic regression model with our dataset.

Accuracy: 88.1 %
The root mean square error is :  0.5876641714748363
The R2 Score is :  0.203932584269663
The Mean Absolute error is :  0.11926605504587157


Conclusion:

In an ideal world, AI and machine learning will enable human forecasters to work more productively, devoting more of their time to informing the general public—or, in the case of private forecasters, their clients—about the implications and repercussions of forecasts. We think the best way to achieve these objectives and increase confidence in computer-generated weather forecasts is through rigorous collaboration between scientists, forecasters, and forecast users.
In this research, we tried demonstrating how machine learning may enhance weather forecasting accuracy by incorporating some algorithms and historical data, allowing us to prevent natural disasters like hurricanes, cyclones, and floods in the future.
